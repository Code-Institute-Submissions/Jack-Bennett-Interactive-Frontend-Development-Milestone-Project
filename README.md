# Jack Bennett Holidays

This website's sole purpose is to provide a platform for those looking to find thier next holiday destination.

## UX

The target audience for this website is those who are trying to find a new destination for a holiday or general travel.

I have done my best to ensure this website is user friendly for all users, regardless of their device. The webpages have been structured so that they will be responsive on any device that you choose to use.

The wireframes for each page on this website have been added into the GitHib files.

**User Stories**

Speaking with some users who were testing my website, I asked them what they would like for my website to provide them. They said:

As a casual visitor, I would like to be able see a variety of different destinations, without having to search for them myself.
As a potential customer, I would like to see incentives to buy from you and reviews from others to increase trust with your brand.

## Features

## Testing
Referring back to the user stories mentioned above, I needed to test that these were possible and whether my site provided what they wanted to see.

Starting with the first user story "As a casual visitor, I would like to be able see a variety of different destinations, without having to search for them myself", I felt there were a couple of ways I could approach this. The first was to add a slideshow onto the homepage which cycled through various countries that were relatively popular. The second idea was to add a section which cycled through various cities that were quite popular. I decided to do both of these things as I felt it gave the visitor plenty of choice and would hoepfully keep them interested. After showing this to the user who initially made the suggestion, they said they were happy with what they saw.

The second user story "As a potential customer, I would like to see incentives to buy from you and reviews from others to increase trust with your brand" was posed as a potential customer. Holidays are expensive and they simply wanted to feel that they could save some money if they chose to use my brand. So, I decided the best option would be to add a discount banner, but also a countdown timer just below it to try and intice a relativly quick buy. After showing this to the user who initially made the suggestion, they confirmed that they would be more inticed to book with my brand due to the discount.

**Bugs/Issues**

Slideshow: With the assistance of W3 Schools, setting up the slideshow was too much hard work. Although, I wanted to make the design of it even better by tweaking the width, height and opacity of each image when they are clicked/not clicked. I had a lot of trouble with this at first, but eventually managed to tweak it to make it look much cleaner.

Countdown Timer: Above the countdown timer is a banner displaying the offer that the countdown is in relation to. I spent a fair bit of time trying to get the countdown timer into the banner itself, which I did manage to do, but it didn't look great in all devices and I had a lot of trouble making it suitable for every device. I therefore decided not to go with this idea and instead kept the countdown timer just below the banner.

## Deployment

My website was built using 'Cloud9' which is a service provided by Amazon. In Cloud9 I regularly saved my website as I was building it, as well as committing my changes to the local repository. Once I had finished building my website, I pushed everything I had built onto GitHub where all my saves/commitments also followed. It has been made public and is available to see for anyone who would like to view it.
